Once-template-project
=====================

This is a NodeJS based project template. It takes advantage of [k-bag](https://github.com/rapitkan/k-bag) building tools and [Once css library](https://github.com/niant/once). Feel free to try it out! This is how you can get started:

Pre-conditions: [NodeJS](http://nodejs.org/download/), [Bower](http://bower.io/) and [git](http://git-scm.com/book/en/Getting-Started-Installing-Git) are properly installed.

1. Open terminal
2. Navigate to a directory where you like to install this template project. For example c:/workspace/ could be fine.
3. Run command `git clone https://github.com/rapitkan/Once-template-project.git`
4. Navigate into the directory of the template project.
5. Run command `git submodule update --init --recursive`
6. Navigate to k-bag directory.
7. Run command `npm install`
8. Run command `bower install`
9. Run command `npm start`
10. Open a valid web browser or Internet Explorer and navigate to [http://localhost:35000](http://localhost:35000).

After the steps above you should have this template project running and everything is ready for serious or less serious development work. Have fun!
